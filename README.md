# PlantDocNet

**PlantDocNet** is a deep learning-based image classification project built using TensorFlow and Keras. It classifies plant leaf diseases using the PlantVillage dataset, applying transfer learning via MobileNetV2. The model supports 16+ plant disease classes and achieves high accuracy using real-world agricultural data.

## Features
- Transfer learning using MobileNetV2
- Augmented image preprocessing pipeline
- Model evaluation with confusion matrix and classification report
- Inference on individual plant leaf images


## Getting Started
